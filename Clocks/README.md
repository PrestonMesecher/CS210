# CS210 Clock Program
## Preston Mesecher

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**  
This project was to create a simple program that shows the time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. Users can input a starting time and add hours, minutes, or seconds to see how it changes. The main goal was solving the need for users to view time easily in both formats. 

**What did you do particularly well?**  
I organized my program clearly, breaking it into small functions that each handled one task. This made the main part of the program easy to read and understand. I also did a good job making sure user inputs were validated to avoid crashes or errors. 

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**  
I could add error handling for unexpected inputs beyond simple numbers. Adding better validation and user-friendly messages would make the program easier to use. Improving these areas would help make my code more user-friendly. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**  
The most challenging part was correctly handling the transition from seconds to minutes and minutes to hours (like when seconds go from 59 to 60). I overcame this by carefully testing my functions step-by-step. I learned to use clear, simple logic to handle rollovers, and I now know it's important to check each small part before moving on. 

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**  
Skills from this project that I'll use in future projects include breaking problems into smaller tasks, validating user inputs, and clearly formatting outputs. Writing simple and understandable code will be valuable in all future coursework and projects. 

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I kept my code readable and understandable by using clear function names and comments explaining each step. This makes it easy to update or fix later if needed. Keeping functions small and specific makes future changes easier.
